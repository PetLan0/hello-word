Hi :D
My name is Peter, I'm 17 years old and I want to work, Â¿Because? you will ask, well first I'm from Guatemala, yeah!, I'm poor, but it I'm going to stop being, I want to learn and work for money, I really don't care what to work on, it sounds bad, but I only care about money, although I am also passionate about programming, everything that has to do with programming and computing interests me, I know that money does not give me happiness, but it gives me freedom, such as having children and that they have all they want, obviously earning it hard.
